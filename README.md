## Eli Assaf

* I really like to go on runs in my free time. I enjoy seeing myself get better and training for triathlons.
* I am enjoying my degree so far and really like learning about ethical hacking and cybersecurity related topics. I am excited to dive more into linux and the project in this class!
* I am apart of a fraternity here on campus and also apart of the cheer team! These hobbies take up much of my time outside of school.

### Technical Experience 

* I have taken multiple cybersecurity classes where I have learned how to ethicaly hack through hands-on coursework.
* I have taken courses such as 162 and 163 which have helped me become a better programmer in python
